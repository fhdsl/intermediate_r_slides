## Goals of the course

- **Apply** tools for Tidying data to get a messy dataset into analysis-ready form, via data recoding, data transformations, and data subsetting.
- **Design** and **Create** simple, custom functions that can be reused throughout an analysis on multiple datasets.
- **Explain** and **utilize** *iteration* in programming to reduce repeated code and batch process collections (such as a folder of files or rows in a table)
-   At the end of the course, you will be able to: conduct a full analysis in the data science workflow (minus model).

## Culture of the course

. . .

-   Learning on the job is challenging
    -   I will move at learner's pace; we are learning together.
    -   Teach not for mastery, but teach for empowerment to learn effectively.

. . .

-   Various personal goals and applications: curate applications based on your interest!

## Culture of the course

-   Challenge: We sometimes struggle with our data science in isolation, unaware that someone two doors down from us has gone through the same struggle.

. . .

-   *We learn and work better with our peers.*

. . .

-   *Know that if you have a question, other people will have it.*

. . .

-   *Asking questions is our way of taking care of others.*

. . .

We ask you to follow [Participation Guidelines](https://hutchdatascience.org/communitystudios/guidelines/) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/fhdsl/coc).

# Set up Posit Cloud and [look at our workspace](https://posit.cloud/spaces/602402/join?access_code=UKlpCyHA04T-B9GXuGoJdJXV-b0o2yGVFDA9d_WC)!

## Before we get started

- We'll do in-class exercises live in the slides
  - These slides actually run R on your computer!
- they are mirrored in your workspaces as `classwork` 
  - You can do them there if you want to keep a record
- Exercises are in your projects

## Exercise Example

Make a vector with the following values: 3, 5, 10. Assign it to an object called `people`. Show the contents of `people`.

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_1
people <- c(--,--,--)
people
```

::: {.solution exercise="ex_1"}

#### Solution

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_1
#| solution: true
people <- c(3,5,10)
people
```

## Data types in R

-   Numeric: 18, -21, 65, 1.25

. . .

-   Character: "ATCG", "Whatever", "948-293-0000"

. . .

-   Logical: TRUE, FALSE

. . .

-   Missing values: `NA`

## Data structures in R

-   `vector`
-   `data.frame`
-   `list`

## Vectors

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- A **vector** contains a data type, and all elements must be the same data type. We can have **logical vectors, numerical vectors**, etc.

- Within the Numeric type that we are familiar with, there are more specific types: **Integer vectors** consists of whole number values, and **Double vectors** consists of decimal values

```r
fib = c(0, 1, 1, NA, 5)
```
:::

:::{.column width="40%"}
![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/eb6730b841e32292d9ff36b33a590e24b6221f43/57192/diagrams/vectors/summary-tree-atomic.png){width="300"}
:::
::::


## Testing for a data type

We can test whether a vector is a certain type with `is.___()` functions, such as `is.character()`.

```{r}
is.character(c("hello", "there"))
```

. . .

For `NA`, the test will return a vector testing each element, because `NA` can be mixed into other values:

```{r}
is.na(c(34, NA))
```

## Coercing

We can **coerce** vectors from one type to the other with `as.___()` functions, such as `as.numeric()`

```{r}
as.numeric(c("23", "45"))
```

. . .

```{r}
as.numeric(c(TRUE, FALSE))
```

## Attributes of data structures

It is common to have metadata **attributes**, such as **names**, attached to R data structures.

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3)
names(x) = c("a", "b", "c")
x
```

. . .

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1140c34226b3b04438aec65c8fc6b28758d8c091/1748a/diagrams/vectors/attr-names-2.png)

. . .

```{r}
x["a"]
```

## `attributes()`

We can look for more general attributes via the `attributes()` function:

```{r}
attributes(x)
```

## Review: explicit subsetting

- We know the indices for our subset, such as "The first two values"

```{r}
data = c(2, 4, -1, -3, 2, -1, 10)
```

. . .

1.  Positive numeric vector 

    ```{r}
    data[c(1, 2, 7)]
    ```

. . .

2.  Negative numeric vector performs *exclusion* 

    ```{r}
    data[c(-1, -2)]
    ```

. . .

3.  Logical vector

```{r}
data[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]
```

## Review: Implicit subsetting

Comparison operators, such as `>`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, create logical vectors for subsetting.

```{r}
data < 0
```

. . .

```{r}
data[data < 0]
```

## Try it out: Vectors 1 (5 minutes, go as far as you can...)

`r countdown(minutes=5)`

1.  How do you subset the following vector so that it only has positive values?

```{webr}
#| exercise: v_1
data = c(2, 4, -1, -3, 2, -1, 10)
data[data -- 0]
```

::: {.solution exercise="v_1"}

#### Solution

```{webr}
#| exercise: v_1
#| solution: true
data = c(2, 4, -1, -3, 2, -1, 10)
data[data > 0]
```
:::


## Vectors 2

2.  How do you subset the following vector so that it has doesn't have the character "temp"?

```{webr}
#| exercise: v_2
chars = c("temp", "object", "temp", "wish", "bumblebee", "temp")
chars[chars -- "temp"]
```

::: {.solution exercise="v_2"}

#### Solution

```{webr}
#| exercise: v_2
#| solution: true
chars = c("temp", "object", "temp", "wish", "bumblebee", "temp")
chars[chars != "temp"]
```
:::


## Vectors 3

3.  Challenge: How do you subset the following vector so that it has no `NA` values?

```{webr}
#| exercise: v_3
vec_with_NA = c(2, 4, NA, NA, 3, NA)
vec_with_NA[!----(vec_with_NA)]
```

::: {.solution exercise="v_3"}

#### Solution

```{webr}
#| exercise: v_3
#| solution: true
vec_with_NA = c(2, 4, NA, NA, 3, NA)
vec_with_NA[!is.na(vec_with_NA)]
```
:::



## `data.frame`

Usually, we load in a `data.frame` from a spreadsheet or a package.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
head(penguins)
```

## `data.frame` attributes

Let's take a look at a `data.frame`'s **attributes**.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
attributes(penguins)
```

. . .

So, we can access the column names of the `data.frame` via `names()` instead of `colnames()`:

```{r}
names(penguins)
```

## Try it out: Subsetting `data.frame`s 1 (5 minutes, go as far as you can)

`r countdown(minutes=5)``

*Subset to the single column `bill_length_mm`:*

```{webr}
#| exercise: df_1
penguins
```

::: {.solution exercise="df_1"}

#### Solution

```{webr}
#| exercise: df_1
#| solution: true
penguins$bill_length_mm
# or
penguins[["bill_length_mm"]]
```
:::


## Subsetting `data.frame`s 2

*I want to select columns `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `species`, and filter the rows so that `species` only has "Gentoo":*

```{webr}
#| exercise: df_2
penguins |>
  select( ) |>
  filter( )
```

::: {.solution exercise="df_2"}

#### Solution

```{webr}
#| exercise: df_2
#| solution: true
penguins |>
  select(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, species) |>
  filter(species == "Gentoo")
```
:::


## Subsetting `data.frame`s 3

*Challenge: I want to filter out rows that have `NA`s in the column `bill_length_mm`:*

```{webr}
#| exercise: df_3
penguins |>
  filter(!----(bill_length_mm))
```

::: {.solution exercise="df_3"}

#### Solution

```{webr}
#| exercise: df_3
#| solution: true
penguins |>
  filter(!is.na(bill_length_mm))
```
:::

## Lists

Lists operate similarly as vectors as they group data into one dimension, but each element of a list can be any data type *or data structure*!

```{r}
l1 = list(
  c(1:3), 
  "a", 
  c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
  c(2.3, 5.9)
)
```

. . .

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9628eed602df6fd55d9bced4fba0a5a85d93db8a/36c16/diagrams/vectors/list.png)

## Lists 2

Unlike vectors, you access the elements of a list via the double bracket `[[]]`. (You will access a smaller list with single bracket `[]`.)

```{r}
l1 = list(
  c(1:3), 
  "a", 
  c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
  c(2.3, 5.9)
)
```

```{r}
l1[[1]]
```

. . .

```{r}
l1[[1]][2]
```

## List names

We can give **names** to lists:

```{r}
l1 = list(
  ranking = c(1:3), 
  name = "a", 
  success =  c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
  score = c(2.3, 5.9)
)
#or
names(l1) = c("ranking", "name", "success", "score")
```

## Accessing List elements

And access named elements of lists via the `[[]]` or `$` operation:

```{r}
l1[["score"]]
# or
l1$score
```

. . .

Therefore, `l1$score` is the same as `l1[[4]]` and is the same as `l1[["score"]]`.

. . .

What data structure does this remind you of?

## Warning: `[]` versus `[[]]`

This always trips me up, you usually want `[[]]` (return an element) versus `[]` (returns a sublist).

```{r}
l1["ranking"]
```

...

```{r}
l1[["ranking"]]
```

## Two main uses for Lists

1. Return a mixed type list of objects, such as from running `lm()` - a lot of methods in R use this.
  - Useful when programming functions that need to return multiple objects
  
. . .  
  
2. Store multiple instances of the same data type, such as a `list` of `data.frame`s
  - Iteration over these lists is possible
  
## Try it Out: Lists 1

`r countdown(minutes=5)`

Return the element in the `id` slot:

```{webr}
#| exercise: list_1
person = list(id=100031, age=40)
person
```

::: {.solution exercise="list_1"}
```{webr}
#| exercise: list_1
#| solution: true
person = list(id=100031, age=40)
person$id
# or
person[["id"]]
```
:::

## Lists 2

Return the 2nd element of this list:

```{webr}
#| exercise: list_2
new_list <- list(c(1,2,3), c(3,4,5), c(5,7,8))
new_list
```

::: {.solution exercise="list_2"}

```{webr}
#| exercise: list_2
#| solution: true
new_list <- list(c(1,2,3), c(3,4,5), c(5,7,8))
new_list[[2]]
```

:::

## Lists 3: Using Variables to Subset

How would you use the value of the `my_col` variable to subset the list?

```{webr}
#| exercise: list_3
person = list(id=100031, age=40)
my_col <- "age"
person
```

::: {.solution exercise="list_3"}

#### Solution

This is the main use for the `[[]]` - you can pass it a variable name.

Note that `person$my_col` is not going to work - it looks for a column called `my_col` in the data.

```{webr}
#| exercise: list_3
#| solution: true
person = list(id=100031, age=40)
my_col <- "age"
person[[my_col]]
```
:::


## `data.frame`s as Lists

A `data.frame` is just a named list of vectors of same length with **attributes** of (column) `names` and `row.names`, so all of the list methods we looked at above apply.

. . .

```{r}
head(penguins)
```

## `data.frame`s as Lists

```{r}
head(penguins[[3]])
head(penguins$bill_length_mm)
head(penguins[["bill_length_mm"]])
```

# Everything in R is a List, or related

## Tools for lists

- `lapply()` function - applies a function to each element of a list
- We'll explore in Week 5 the `{purrr}` package, which has methods for working with lists


## That's all!
